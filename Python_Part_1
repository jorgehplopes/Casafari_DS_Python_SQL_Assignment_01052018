- Classify the type of each listing:

The classification of the type of each listing was performed by "in" string search command over the "title" column.
Before that, a pre-processing step was performed, in order to avoid futher problems in classification, which includes:
  - delete all empty "title" regsiters, 
  - lower case the entire column,
  - replace special characters.
Can be some problems with this procedure if the description of the property was miswrite in the file, p.e., "vila" instead of "villa".



- Classify the location of each listing:

The procedure was very simiar to type classification descrive above. The search was also performed over the "title" column.
Can be some problems with this procedure if the description of the property was miswrite in the file, p.e., "Quinta Marinha" instead "Quinta da Marinha".
