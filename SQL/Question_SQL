# Problems to be solved with SQL:

# Supose that I have a table called "assignment_data" with "id","title","features","living_area","total_area","plot_area"
and "price" columns:


- Write a query to extract only listings with a property type “quinta” or “house”

  select *
  from assignment_data
  where title like '%quinta%' or title like '%house%'



- Write a query to extract only listings of properties with a pool

  select *
  from assignment_data
  where features like '%pool%'



- Write a query to extract listings where a property type is not “plot”

  select *
  from assignment_data
  where title not like '%plot%'



- Write a query calculating the average price per square meter of all apartments in Nagüeles

  alter table assignment_data
  add area smallint
  
  update assignment_data
  set area = (select max(x) from (values (total_area),(living_area)) as x(x))
    
  select avg(price/area)
  from assignment_data
  where title like '%apartments%' and title like '%Nagueles%'
