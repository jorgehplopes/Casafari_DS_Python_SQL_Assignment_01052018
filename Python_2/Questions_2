The "under-valued", "over-valued" and "normal" labels were obtained by comparing, for each property, their price_per_area with
the average price_per_area for similar properties.

Thus, the average price_per_area for each property types (apartments, houses and plots) in each location (Alenquer, Quinta da Marinha, 
Golden Mile and Nag√ºeles) was defined and calculated (3 x 4 = 12 average price_per_area were calculated).

It was defined that properties are over-valued if their price_per_area is 15% higher than the average price_per_area for similar properties.
Properties are under-valued if their price_per_area is 15% lower than the average price_per_area for similar properties.
Then, in between, are the normal valuated properties.

It was assumed that a flunctuation of 15% over the average price_per_area was the best value to define "under-valued", "over-valued" and 
"normal" valuations.

Outliers are different from "under-valued", "over-valued". While "under-valued" and "over-valued" properties assume possible and logic 
values for their price_per_area, outliers are registers which price_per_area is far above or far below from average price and, thus,
distant (very different) from other price_per_area.
Outliers may come from unusual but correct situations (p.e. if the property has a historic value) or incorrect value input in data file.
