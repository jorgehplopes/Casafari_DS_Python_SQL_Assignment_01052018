- Classify the type of each listing:
The classification of the type of each listing was performed by "in" string search command over the "title" column.
Before that, a pre-processing step was performed, in order to avoid further problems in classification, which includes:
  - check if there is any empty "title" registers, 
  - lower case the entire "title" column,
  - replace special characters.
Some problems can occur with this procedure if the description of the property was miswritten in the file, p.e., "vila" instead of "villa".


- Classify the location of each listing:
The procedure was very similar to type classification describe above. The search was also performed over the "title" column.
Some problems can occur with this procedure if the description of the property was miswritten in the file, p.e., "Quinta Marinha" 
instead "Quinta da Marinha".


- It was decided to delete the registers where "features" was empty. Since the goal is to obtain the price impact of ‘pool’, 
‘sea view’ and ‘garage’ features on properties, there is no utility in empty features registers.
